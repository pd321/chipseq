  # Size of the bins, in bases,

  # --smoothLength   
  # The smooth length defines a window, 
  # larger than the binSize, to average the number of reads. 
  # For example, if the –binSize is set to 20 and the –smoothLength is set to 60, 
  # then, for each bin, the average of the bin and its left and right neighbors 
  # is considered. Any value smaller than –binSize will be ignored and no smoothing 
  # will be applied.
  smooth_length: 30

  # --normalizeUsing 
  #   Possible choices: RPKM, CPM, BPM, RPGC, None   Use one of the entered
  # methods to normalize the number of reads per bin.    By default, no normalization is
  # performed. RPKM = Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads;    CPM = Counts Per
  # Million mapped reads, same as CPM in RNA-seq; BPM = Bins Per Million mapped reads,   
  # same as TPM in RNA-seq; RPGC = reads per genomic content (1x normalization);   
  # Mapped reads are considered after blacklist filtering (if applied).    RPKM (per bin)
  # = number of reads per bin / (number of mapped reads (in millions) * bin length
  # (kb)).    CPM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / number of mapped reads (in
  # millions).    BPM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / sum of all reads per bin (in
  # millions).    RPGC (per bin) = number of reads per bin / scaling factor for 1x average
  # coverage.    None = the default and equivalent to not setting this option at all.   
  # This scaling factor, in turn, is determined from the sequencing    depth: (total
  # number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size.    The scaling
  # factor used is the inverse of the sequencing depth computed for the    sample to
  # match the 1x coverage. This option requires –effectiveGenomeSize.    Each read is
  # considered independently, if you want to only count one mate from a    pair in paired-end
  # data, then use the –samFlagInclude/–samFlagExclude options. (Default: None)
  normalize_using: 'CPM'

  # --extendReads, -e
  #    This parameter allows the extension of reads to fragment size. If set, each
  # read is extended, without exception. NOTE: This feature is generally NOT
  # recommended for spliced-read data, such as RNA-seq, as it would extend reads over skipped
  # regions. Single-end: Requires a user specified value for the final fragment length.
  # Reads that already exceed this fragment length will not be extended. Paired-end:
  # Reads with mates are always extended to match the fragment size defined by the two
  # read mates. Unmated reads, mate reads that map too far apart (>4x fragment length)
  # or even map to different chromosomes are treated like single-end reads. The input
  # of a fragment length value is optional. If no value is specified, it is estimated
  # from the data (mean of the fragment size of all mate reads).
  # NOTE: this setting in config is only applicable to single end data
